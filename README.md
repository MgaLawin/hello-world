Practice project

I was born in Washington state, and other than my mission, have only lived in the western side of Washington state.  While in Washington, I have lived in only 5 different cities.

I served my mission in the Cabanatuan Philippines Mission from January 1993 until January 1995.  I served in four incredible areas:

1. Moncada, Tarlac
2. Jaen, Nueva Ecija
3. Concepcion, Tarlac
4. Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija

Something interesting about myself is that I did not start to learn to walk or talk until after turning two years of age. This was due to having many petit mal epileptic seizures. It took many visits to several different doctors, before they could diagnose me with that. Initially they just claimed that my mother was just overprotective and imagining things with her first child (I’m her second), then that I was deaf (I was not), then that I was stupid, and so on. Once they diagnosed me with epilepsy, and realized that my mother (now single after my father abandoned us), had two other children, they recommended that she institutionalize me because I would be mentally and physically retarded my entire life and too much of a burden for her. She refused to accept their recommendation. Instead she read with me constantly, had me take gymnastics and tap dancing, and enrolled me in the “special ed” speech therapy classes. We quickly proved the doctors wrong as I am far from being mentally or physically retarded.

My experience with IT started in 4th grade when we used TI-80 systems in school and had a Commodore 64 at home. I built upon that in my senior year of high school when I took my first computer science class on Mac SE machines. After graduating, I built my first PC from scratch. It contained an Intel 386-33 Mhz processer, 2 MB of RAM, a 30 MB HDD, and both a 3.5” and a 5.25” FDD. It booted to MS-DOS and could then launch Windows 3.0. I soon had to spend an additional $300 in order to install a secondary 300 MB HDD so that I could fully install Wing Commander 2 and not have to keep swapping floppy disks. Shortly after returning home from my mission in the Philippines, I was hired by IBM to do break-fix work on their Boeing contract. Since then I have moved up to my current role of IT Security Officer and Systems Administrator at Green River College in Auburn, WA. I have had to do a bit of scripting while deploying software or automating tasks, and a tiny bit for querying data. I have dabbled with having my own website created using Frontpage 97 and other online sites, and have done a bit of SharePoint administration. I was Microsoft’s front-end SharePoint administrator (look and feel plus content, but not back-end permissions or layout) for the Windows XP SP2 roll-out to coordinate their many tech support teams they had on hand for that event. Other than that (and the CIT 160 course), I have done very little with coding or websites, so I look forward to this class.
